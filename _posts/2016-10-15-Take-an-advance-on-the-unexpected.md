Recently, we wrote a short review of some <b>(emerging) tools</b> that can be used by responders and managers during <b>emergency & crisis response</b>, for the participants to the Disaster Medicine Program of the Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles (ULB). We thought it might be of interest for you as well. In twelve printed pages, we had to make some choices, and could not discuss every item in detail. But what techniques do you use? Share them on Twitter and our Facebook page!<br>

You can <a href='https://docs.my-poppy.eu/2016_kta_poppy_devancer_inattendu.pdf'>download it</a>, spread the word and comment it on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/mypoppy_eu"><i class="fa fa-twitter fa-fw fa-1x"></i></a>&nbsp; or our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mypoppyeu"><i class="fa fa-facebook fa-fw fa-1x"></i></a> page!
